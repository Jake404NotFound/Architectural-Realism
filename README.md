# Architectural Realism

### A Minecraft Mod for Realistic Building Physics  

**Architectural Realism** is a mod that introduces realistic structural integrity mechanics to Minecraft. In vanilla Minecraft, blocks can float indefinitely, defying the laws of physics. This mod changes that by requiring blocks to have proper support—if a block loses all structural connections, it will fall.  

With **Architectural Realism**, you'll need to think like an architect, using beams, columns, and strong foundations to support your builds. No more unrealistic floating structures—gravity now plays a crucial role in construction!

## 📜 Features

- **Structural Integrity System** – Blocks require support to stay in place.
- **Gravity-Based Collapse** – Unsupported blocks will fall when their connection is severed.
- **Customizable Config** – Adjust block weight, support range, and collapse rules.
- **Survival-Friendly** – Encourages realistic construction methods.
- **Redstone Compatibility** – Use pistons and explosions strategically to cause collapses.
- **Mod Compatibility** – Works alongside other building mods.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Blocks Need Support** – Each block must be connected to a solid foundation to stay in place.
2. **Weight and Material Matter** – Different blocks have different weight values; weaker materials require more support.
3. **Gravity Applies** – If a structure lacks sufficient support, affected blocks will collapse.
4. **Chain Reactions** – Removing a critical support block can bring down entire sections of a build.
